Notes for April 12th meeting
1. We *think* we want to use millisecond. 
2. Let's see if we can find a navon milli demo. to adapt for our purposes. 
2a. We might then need to make our own stimuli to present (which we had been considering anyway).
3. Upload demo code once found. 
4. Let's review original navon paper and a few relevant papers from cultural psych and hemi asymm lit that could inform decisions about the paradigm. 
4a. Navon, 1977; McKone et al. 2010; Yovel et al. 2001; Rezvani et al. 2020
5. Run Inquisit Navon demo on different screens / displays. 
5a. Make sure retina and non-retina screens look the same.
6. Read through script notes. 

7. First thing we can do to alter code and run is to change it to 2 presentation locations instead of 4, then test run to make sure it all works. Baby step first change to get oriented. 

Note 1: We also made a document of differnet experimental design decisions and analysis decisions.
