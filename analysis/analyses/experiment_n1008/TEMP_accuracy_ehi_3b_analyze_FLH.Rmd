28.144 - 14.822 = 13.322ms \\
13.322/200 = 0.067ms / EHI unit
$$
The model estimates that an average strong right hander (EHI +100) will have **13.32ms** more LVF global bias than a strong left hander (EHI -100). Each unit change in EHI (-100:100) corresponds to a **0.067ms** difference in LVF global bias. This is also the slope estimate given by the summary function:
