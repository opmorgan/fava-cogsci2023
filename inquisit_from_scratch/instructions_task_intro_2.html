      Each time, you will be shown a cross in the center of the screen, then shapes, and then a rectangle made of hashtags which you can ignore.
      <br>
      <br>
      Your job will be to focus your eyes on the center of the screen, and <strong>press an assigned key whenever you see a circle or square anywhere on the screen.</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      The circle or square might be little or bigâ€”press the key any time you see any circle or square.
      <br>
      <br>
      (We will tell you which key to use before each round)
