# Experiment design decisions
Design parameters for the lateral presentation task are discussed in detail in this google sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brRKj0Jy2RazAuAf1SCSuL6Zg7Xw1xi6BNSHdeUudZs/edit?usp=sharing

## Presentation time

## Divided versus focused attention

## Which letters to use (symmetrical letters only?)
### How many distinct letters?

## Response type: GNG versus 2C

## Relative size of local vs. global letters (cf. Yovel's "equal salience")

## Absolute stimulus size

## Trials

## Number of blocks, number of trials per block

## Inter-block rest duration and prompt

## Number of participants

## Mask

## Viewing distance (Can try to control with stimulus size, device restrictions)

## Attention checks

## Stimulus cues - visual and/or auditory?
If auditory, need sound checks.

## Stimulus position
### Vertical position (Center)
### (Asym only) Stimuli distance from center



# Analysis decisions

## Exclude RTs outside a certain range?

## Include only correct or all responses?

## Accuracy vs. RT?

## To transform or not transform RTs?
### Use statistical tests?
